## Versioning system
```
2.23.2 ← patch
↑ ↑
│ minor
major
```
This engine uses a semver-pride-versioning system. Breaking changes (NNUE format, UCI option
deletion, etc.) require a major version bump, except v0 increments minor version. New engine
features bump minor version and patches bump patch version.

Also, if I am happy with the elo gain on SPRT, major version will be bumped.
